Decentralized Identity Verification System (DIVS)

📌 Overview
The Decentralized Identity Verification System (DIVS) is a blockchain-based solution designed to provide secure, tamper-proof, and user-controlled identity verification. It eliminates central authority dependency, enhances privacy, and prevents identity fraud using Ethereum/Solana, IPFS, and smart contracts.

🚀 Features
- Decentralized Identity Storage – Uses IPFS & Blockchain for immutable record-keeping.
- User-Controlled Data Access – Individuals can grant/revoke access to their identity.
- Tamper-Proof Verification – Cryptographic hashing ensures data security.
- Interoperable & Scalable – Can be integrated into finance, healthcare, education, and more.
- Smart Contracts Automation – Handles access control and verification.

🛠 Tech Stack
- Frontend: React.js
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js
- Blockchain: Ethereum/Solana, Smart Contracts (Solidity)
- Storage: IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)
- Database: MySQL (for metadata management)

🔗 System Architecture
1. Users register and upload identity data.
2. Identity Issuers verify and sign credentials before storing them on IPFS and blockchain.
3. Verifiers request validation, and blockchain authenticates data using cryptographic proofs.
4. Smart Contracts automate access control, ensuring secure and trustless verification.
